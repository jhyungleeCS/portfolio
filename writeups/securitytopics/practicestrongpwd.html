        <h3>Reasons why a strong password is important</h3>
        <p>
        It is almost inevitable that a daily user of the Internet like you and I have some sort of account/information available on the Internet. 
        <br>
        <br>
        But with the account, a lot of them come with weak passwords or poor password hygiene. 
        <br>
        <br>
        A strong password is crucial for many different reasons: 
        <br>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Protecting Your Data: A strong password helps safeguard your personal and sensitive information from unauthorized access, reducing the risk of data breaches and identity theft.</li>
            <li>Defends Against Brute Force Attacks: Bad actors can use automated programs to guess passwords through brute force. A strong password makes it much harder to crack, making these attacks less likely to succeed. </li>
            <li>Ensures Privacy: Strong passwords help maintain the confidentiality of your communications, emails, and other online interactions, ensuring your private information stays private.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Recommended Security Policies/Standards</h3>
        <p>
        The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) provides guidelines for various aspects of cybersecurity, including password management and best practices. 
        <br>
        <br>
        A standard that specifically addresses password practices is NIST Special Publication 800-63B. 
        <br>
        <br>
        This publication focuses on authentication and lifecycle management, and it includes comprehensive recommendations for creating and managing passwords securely. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Some key points that the NIST SP 800-63B mentions regarding password practices include: 
        <ul>
            <li>Length Over Complexity: NIST recommends that passwords should be at least 8 characters long, with mixed case and special characters. </li>
            <li>Avoiding Frequent Password Changes: NIST discourages forcing users to change passwords at regular intervals unless there is a known compromise. Frequent changes can lead to weaker passwords and user frustration. </li>
            <li>Secure Password Storage: Passwords should be stored securely using appropriate hashing algorithms, ensuring that they cannot be easily recovered or reverse-engineered. </li>
            <li>Banning Commonly Used Passwords: Organizations and users should check against known lists of commonly used or compromised passwords to prevent users from choosing weak passwords. </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
