        <h3>Determining Malware Types </h3>
        <p>
        Malware or malicious software is defined as a wide range of software that has malicious intent. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Often, malware is not software that you would knowingly download. 
        <br>
        <br>
        It is installed onto your system through devious means. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Infected systems can show various symptoms including: running slower, starting unknown processes, sending out email without user action, rebooting randomly, and more.
        <br>
        <br>
        These are common malwares that are frequently used by attackers:
        <ul>
            <li>Viruses</li>
            <li>Worms</li>
            <li>Logic Bombs</li>
            <li>Backdoors</li>
            <li>Trojans</li>
            <li>Spyware</li>
            <li>Rootkit</li>
            <li>Ransomware</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Viruses</h3>
        <p>
        A virus is a malicious code that attaches itself to a host application.
        <br>
        <br>
        The host application must be executed in order to run and alongside it, the malicious code executes when the host application is executed. 
        <br>
        <br>
        The virus will try to replicate other host applications with malicious code. 
        <br>
        <br>
        At some point, the virus will activate and deliver its payload which can be damaging by deleting files, causing random reboots, join the computer to a botnet or even enable backdoors. 
        </p>
        <h3>Worms</h3>
        <p>
        A worm is a self-replicating malware that travels through a network without the assistance of a host application or any user interaction.
        <br>
        <br>
        A worm can reside inside of memory and can also use different transport protocols to travel over the network. 
        <br>
        <br>
        One of the significant problems caused by worms is that they consume a lot of network bandwidth, which can cause congestion and slower run times. 
        </p>
        <h3>Logic Bombs</h3>
        <p>
        A logic bomb is a string of code embedded into an application or script that will execute in response to an event. 
        <br>
        <br>
        The event might be a specific date or time, or a user action such as when a user launches a specific program. 
        </p>
        <h3>Backdoors</h3>
        <p>
        A backdoor is a of providing another way of accessing a system, similar to how a backdoor in a house provides another method of entry. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Usually this way of accessing is hidden from the public. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Malware often install backdoors on systems to bypass normal authentication methods. 
        <br>
        <br>
        There are many types of malware that create a backdoor quickly after infecting a system or a network. 
        </p>
        <h3>Trojans</h3>
        <p>
        A trojan, or trojan horse, is typically something that looks beneficial but is actually something malicious. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Named famously after the trojan horse, it can come as pirated software or a useful utility that users may be enticed to download or try out. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Alongside this, attackers often use drive-by downloads to deliver trojans. 
        <br>
        <br>
        In the drive-by download, web servers that include malicious code that attempts to download and install itself on users computers after the user visits the site. 
        </p>
        <h3>Spyware</h3>
        <p>
        Spyware is a software that is installed on users’ systems without their awareness or consent.
        <br>
        <br>
        Its purpose is to mainly monitor the user’s computer activity. 
        <br>
        <br>
        With spyware, they are able to learn about information and send this to a third party. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Spyware can access user’s private data, which results in a loss of confidentiality. 
        </p>
        <h3>Rootkit</h3>
        <p>
        A rootkit is a group of programs that hide the fact that the system has been infected or compromised by malicious code. 
        <br>
        <br>
        The goal of the rootkit is to modify the internal operating system processes such as the Registry. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Rootkits have system-level access to systems “root access” and use hooked processes to intercept calls to the operating system. 
        <br>
        <br>
        It is hard to detect rootkits, but antivirus software can detect hooked processes by examining the contents of the system’s RAM or by booting into safe mode. 
        </p>
        <h3>Ransomware</h3>
        <p>
        Ransomware is used by attackers to take control of computers or networks, locking out users. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Similar to ransomware, crypto malware is used to encrypt the data on the computers within the network to prevent access. 
        <br>
        <br>
        In both cases, attackers then demand that the user or organization pay a ransom to regain access to the data or computers. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Sometimes, they won’t even give you your data back (they are criminals at the end).  
        <br>
        <br>
        Today, almost all ransomware attacks use crypto malware techniques. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Criminals often deliver these attacks through drive-by downloads or embedded in other software delivered via email.
